# Documentation
Administrative and scientific papers are given.

- Temporarily, the report about VLF data analysis has been uploaded in Czech. We will try to translate the paper quickly.
You are welcome to share your own papers via this repository :-).

- The database was extended by enclosing a conception of a new paper. It was compiled according to the IBWS conference (http://www.ibws.cz/) where our recent results were presented. It focuses on the new physical model describing the D ionospheric region. Thus, it can partially replace reading the whole long report.
